## Implementation Guidelines

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach
- Each major task begins with comprehensive test writing
- Tests should cover happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all implementation
- Maintain test coverage above 85% for critical paths
- Integration tests should validate end-to-end workflows

### Technical Dependencies
- Database schema must be implemented before API development
- Authentication system is required for all protected endpoints
- WebSocket infrastructure needed before voting functionality
- CI/CD pipeline should be established early for iterative deployment
- Monitoring must be configured before production deployment

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before moving to next phase
- Code review required for all major components
- Security review required for authentication and voting logic
- Performance benchmarks must meet defined thresholds
- Documentation must be complete and accurate

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement database migrations with rollback procedures
- Test WebSocket reconnection scenarios thoroughly
- Validate voting integrity under network interruptions
- Plan for graceful degradation of real-time features
- Implement comprehensive error logging and monitoring
