Set up local development environment for Censeo story pointing application and implement three incremental, testable chunks of core functionality. Each chunk builds upon the previous while maintaining simplicity and clear separation of concerns between containerized services.

## Key Points
- Fully containerized development environment with Docker (Django backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL database)
- Complete voting workflow from session creation to vote revelation and results display
- Three-phase implementation approach with basic session management, story voting system, and vote reveal controls
