# Product Requirements Document - Story Pointing Application

## Overview

A simple, secure, real-time story pointing application that enables agile teams to collaboratively estimate work through blind voting sessions.

## Problem Statement

Teams need a simple, focused tool for story pointing that:
- Prevents voting bias by hiding votes until all members vote
- Handles real-world scenarios (disconnections, absent members)
- Provides audit trails for retrospectives
- Maintains security and prevents abuse
- Works reliably with real-time updates

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Agile development teams (5-15 members)
- **Secondary**: Project managers, scrum masters, product owners
- **User Personas**: 
  - Facilitator (scrum master/team lead)
  - Team member (developer/designer/tester)

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication
- **Magic link authentication** (passwordless)
- Email-based login with secure token validation
- Session management with appropriate timeouts
- **Future enhancement**: Passkey support

### 2. Team Management
- Create teams with unique identifiers
- Invite users via email to join teams
- **Role-based permissions**:
  - **Facilitator**: Create meetings, add/edit stories, control vote reveals, manage team members, exclude voters
  - **Team Member**: View stories, cast votes, participate in discussions
- Team-level configuration (pointing scale, limits)

### 3. Meeting/Session Management
- Create new pointing sessions within teams
- Join active sessions via shareable links
- Real-time participant list showing who's present/absent
- Session history and audit trail

### 4. Story Management
- **Manual story entry** in two modes:
  - One-by-one entry during meetings
  - Bulk entry via multi-line text input
- Edit story details (title, description)
- Story ordering and navigation
- **Future enhancement**: CSV import, JIRA/GitHub integration

### 5. Pointing System
- **Default scale**: Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ?)
- **Alternative scales**: T-shirt sizes (XS-XXL), Powers of 2 (1-32)
- Team-level scale configuration with change tracking
- Scale change warnings for historical data impact

### 6. Voting Workflow
- **Blind voting**: Votes hidden until all active voters complete
- Real-time voting status (who has voted, not what they voted)
- **Manual reveal control**: Facilitator decides when to show results
- **Temporary voter exclusion**: Handle absent/disconnected members
- Vote locking after reveal (prevents post-reveal changes)
- **Reconnection handling**: Disconnected users must vote before seeing results

### 7. Real-time Communication
- **Socket.IO implementation** with automatic reconnection
- Real-time updates for:
  - User join/leave events
  - Story additions/changes
  - Vote casting status
  - Vote reveals
  - Meeting progression
- **Connection management**:
  - 60-second disconnection timeout (configurable)
  - Visual distinction between "temporarily disconnected" vs "marked absent"
  - Auto-catch-up for users who missed stories

### 8. Security & Resource Protection
- **Configurable limits** (no redeployment required):
  - Maximum 50 stories per meeting
  - Maximum 15 team members per team
  - Maximum 5 meetings per team per day
  - 60-second disconnection timeout
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Audit logging of security events

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Support 15 concurrent users per meeting
- Sub-second response times for voting actions
- Real-time updates with <200ms latency
- Graceful handling of temporary disconnections

### Security
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- No storage of secrets in code or configuration files
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Protection against SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks
- Resource limits to prevent abuse

### Reliability
- 99.5% uptime target
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automatic failover for database connections
- Data backup and recovery procedures

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability via Cloud Run
- Database connection pooling
- Efficient real-time connection management

## User Stories

### Facilitator Stories
- As a facilitator, I want to create a team and invite members so we can start pointing stories
- As a facilitator, I want to create a pointing meeting and add stories so the team can estimate work
- As a facilitator, I want to control when votes are revealed so I can ensure all voters have participated
- As a facilitator, I want to temporarily exclude absent members so voting isn't blocked by disconnected users
- As a facilitator, I want to see who has voted (without seeing the votes) so I know when to reveal results

### Team Member Stories
- As a team member, I want to join meetings via a link so I can participate in pointing sessions
- As a team member, I want to cast and change my vote before reveal so I can reconsider my estimate
- As a team member, I want to see voting progress so I know if we're waiting for others
- As a team member, I want automatic reconnection if I lose connection so I don't miss the session

### Reconnection Edge Cases
- As a disconnected user, I want to vote on the current story without seeing others' votes, even if votes were already revealed while I was disconnected
- As a disconnected user, I want to automatically catch up to the current story if the team moved on while I was away

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Average session duration: 30-60 minutes
- Stories pointed per session: 10-25
- User return rate: >70% for teams that complete first session

### Technical Performance
- Real-time update delivery: >99% success rate
- Connection stability: <5% disconnection rate
- Vote reveal accuracy: 100% (no premature reveals)

### Security & Reliability
- Zero security incidents
- System uptime: >99.5%
- Resource limit violations: <1% of requests

## Technical Constraints

- Must use Google Cloud Platform for hosting
- Must maintain audit trails for all user actions
- Must handle real-time communication for up to 15 concurrent users
- Must be configurable without requiring deployments
- Must support passwordless authentication

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

### Phase 2 (3-6 months)
- **Passkey authentication** for improved security
- **Enhanced reporting dashboard** with analytics
- **CSV/bulk story import** functionality
- **Performance optimization** with Redis caching

### Phase 3 (6+ months)
