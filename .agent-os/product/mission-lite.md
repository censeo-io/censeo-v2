# Censeo Mission (Lite)

Censeo is a story pointing application that helps agile development teams collaboratively estimate work through blind voting sessions by providing real-time collaboration and secure vote management.

Censeo serves agile development teams (5-15 members) who need bias-free story estimation during sprint planning sessions. Unlike traditional planning poker tools, Censeo provides blind voting with facilitator-controlled reveals and intelligent reconnection handling for disconnected users. This results in more accurate estimations and 95% session completion rates even with unstable connections.
