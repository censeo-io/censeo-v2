# Product Mission (Lite)

Censeo is a story pointing application that helps agile development teams estimate work collaboratively by providing secure, real-time blind voting sessions with intelligent reconnection handling.

Censeo serves agile development teams (5-15 members) who need unbiased story estimation during sprint planning. Unlike traditional pointing tools that show votes in real-time or fail during disconnections, Censeo provides true blind voting with smart reconnection that prevents estimation bias while handling real-world disruptions seamlessly.
